# GTORK: Garmin to RunKeeper

A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application, allowing users to upload their [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) activities to [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/)

## Motivation

My wife's been using Runkeeper for a long time and likes the interface, incluing the Runkeeper Pro graphs, but she also likes to use her Garmin Watch.
